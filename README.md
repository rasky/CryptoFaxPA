# CryptoFaxPA 2.0 ðŸ“ 

After the huge success of the [first model of CryptoFaxPa](https://teamdigitale.governo.it/upload/docs/2018/cryptofax-pa-it.pdf) officially launched on April, 1st 2018, a revamped and much more powerful version is now available. Yes, it's fully open source.

## How it works

Plug it to a power socket and enjoy:

* GSM connection
* WiFi connection (whenever the HELP button is pressed, CryptoFaxPA will launch an access point that allows WiFi configuration)
* a HELP button which instantly prints installation instructions
* a BLOCKCHAIN button which prints super-nerd blockchain information such as real-time Bitcoin value and other juicy things, along with a very pretty chart
* whenever a message is sent to the @CryptoFaxPA bot on Slack, it will be encrypted and sent to the device as a fax (actually, a cryptofax), and instantly printed
* while printing, a glorious 56k modem sound is emitted
* images are printed as well, and the Slack bot will actually show a preprocessed preview to the sender asking for confirmation - we don't want to send bad looking images
* in case a fax cannot be delivered to the device or printed successfully, it will be kept in spool

## Bill of materials:

* Raspberry PI 3 B+
* Pipsta thermal printer
* 2 push buttons (and 2 10kOhm resistors)
* PAM8302 audio amplifier
* loudspeakers
* GSM USB modem (such as the Huawei E3531)

## Repository contents:

* [CryptoFaxPA_Leaflet_A3.pdf](CryptoFaxPA_Leaflet_A3.pdf): leaflet
* [CryptoFaxPA.scad](CryptoFaxPA.scad): 3D model
* [backend](backend): contains the bot that reacts to Slack messages and preprocesses them before adding them to a MQTT queue
* [client](client): contains the client that runs on the CryptoFaxPA device
* [common](common): contains common code shared by the other components
* [wificonf](wificonf): contains the files to be replaced on a vanilla Raspbian Stretch
* [overlay](overlay): contains the WiFi configuration tool

## Compilation

Make sure you have Go 1.11 and issue `GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm go build` on your machine. Then `scp` the compiled `client` binary (along with the .ogg files) to the device
